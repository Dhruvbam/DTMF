## About
This project was created as part of an assignment for CS 1330 - Computational Thinking Data Science. The goal was to develop a tool that decodes telephone keypad digits from audio signals, integrating concepts from data science, machine learning, and Python programming.

## Description
The DTMF Decoder analyzes WAV audio files to decode telephone keypad digits. It utilizes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to match audio signals with predefined numeric digits, showcasing our team's ability to efficiently process and decode DTMF signals.

### Built With
- Python
- Libraries used:
  - NumPy for FFT implementation
  - pandas for data manipulation
  - SciPy for signal processing

## Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/repository_name.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks (`DTMF - Part 1 - Final.ipynb` through `DTMF - Part 4 - Final.ipynb`) in sequence to experience the encoding, decoding, and analysis process.

## Learning Outcome
Through this project, I learned how to apply FFT for audio signal processing and integrate machine learning libraries with Python scripting. The project covered concepts like audio file processing, digital signal decoding, and using scientific libraries for data analysis, developed primarily using Python.
