## About
The DTMF Decoder is a Python-based tool developed to decode digits from audio signals generated by telephone keypads. The project employs Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques to analyze dual-tone frequencies and identify numeric or symbolic inputs (0-9, *, #). This project highlights foundational skills in signal processing, real-time data analysis, and Python programming.

## Description
The DTMF Decoder processes WAV audio files to decode telephone keypad digits by analyzing the distinct dual-tone frequencies associated with each keypress. It uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for efficient frequency decomposition, allowing it to match audio signals with the standard DTMF frequency table. Noise-filtering techniques are implemented to ensure accuracy even in noisy environments, resulting in an effective and reliable decoder. This project emphasizes my ability to work with real-world audio data, leveraging Python libraries like NumPy and SciPy for frequency analysis and signal processing.

## Learning Outcome
Developing the DTMF Decoder provided in-depth experience in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and real-time audio analysis. I gained practical skills in applying FFT for signal decomposition, implementing noise-filtering techniques to enhance accuracy, and managing real-world audio data in Python. This project also improved my problem-solving abilities, particularly in handling noisy data and optimizing processing speed for near-instantaneous results.
