# Dual Tone Multi-Frequency Decoder
Dual Tone Multi-Frequency Decoder made using python

## About:
In my Python project focused on DTMF, I led a 2-person team to properly decode telephone keypad digits. To achieve this, we utilized data science and machine learning libraries, and Python scripting to decode the digits. Additionally, we developed an encoder to get the frequency of each digit and a decoder for the telephone keypad digits. Our final product is a Dual Tone Multi-Frequency Decoder made using Python, which takes audio files in WAV format of digital number dial tones, slices up each tone, and matches it with a database of numbers corresponding with its audio frequencies. To implement this, we made use of Fast Fourier Transform and implemented FFT into the Python program.
